# EVENet
"EVENet: Evidence-based Ensemble Learning for Uncertainty-aware Brain Parcellation using Diffusion MRI"
## Overview
Evidence-based Ensemble Neural Network (EVENet) is a novel uncertainty-aware deep learning method for anatomical brain parcellation of cortical and subcortical regions directly from dMRI data. The key innovation of EVENet is its utilization of evidential deep learning to quantify uncertainty at each voxel during a single inference. The development of the model is based on [FastSurfer](https://github.com/Deep-MI/FastSurfer/tree/dev).
